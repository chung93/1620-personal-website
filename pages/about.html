    <p>Hello! My name is Cienna Chung and I'm currently studying computer science at BCIT. In fact, this is a project for one of my classes (which I will list below)!</p>
    
    <p>I'm <em>super</em> passionate about story-telling, so I'm trying to get into game development to make something for people to enjoy!</p>
        
    <p>Previously, I studied <strong>2D animation</strong> at Capilano University, and I hope to combine programming and drawing in my future endeavors!</p>
